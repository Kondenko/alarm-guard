## AlarmGuard
### Tiny Android app written in Kotlin

![App icon](https://github.com/Kondenko/alarm-guard/blob/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)

It makes sure your phone's alarm volume is not too low. Because if it is, you will most likely oversleep tomorrow. 
AlarmGuard doesn't want you to, so install it and wake up right in time every day.

[Get apk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6T71HBrEWpANEhnSTNDcTZKWDg)

This app includes:
- SharedPreferences
- Service
- BroadcastReveiver
- ContentObserver

so if you need an example of using these things in Kotlin, you can find it here.

Disclaimer:
I'm sure this is not the best example of Kotlin code. Actually this is my first ever Android app written in something other than Java.
If there's something wrong about my code (and the app), please tell me. Thanks in advance.
