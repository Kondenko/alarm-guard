## AlarmGuard
### Tiny Android app written in Kotlin

![App icon](https://github.com/Kondenko/alarm-guard/blob/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)

This app makes sure your phone's alarm volume is not too low. If it is, AlarmGuard will send you a notification or raise it for you. 
AlarmGuard doesn't want you to oversleep for your classes or your job, so install it and wake up right in time every day.

This app uses:
- SharedPreferences
- Service
- BroadcastReveiver
- ContentObserver

so if you need an example of using these things in Kotlin, you can find it here.

Disclaimer:
I'm sure this is not the best example of Kotlin code. Actually this is my first Android app written in something other than Java.
If there's something wrong about my code (and the app), please tell me. Thanks in advance.
